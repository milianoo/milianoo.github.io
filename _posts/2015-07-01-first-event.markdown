![Kuala Lumpur Docker Meetup]({{ site.url }}/img/post/docker-1.jpg)

Last July we had out first docker meetup in KL. we had no clue about our audience and tech community here in KL before our first meetup however we shocked while checking fast growing RSVP list.

Soon we learnt that the community has a strong interest to know about docker when near to 100 attendance attended our meetup.

Introduction to Docker and how we can use it. 

Docker is an open source project to pack, ship and run any application as a lightweight container.

Docker containers are both hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic. This means they can run anywhere and they don't require you to use a particular language, framework or packaging system.

we are going to have a speak about docker and how we it revolutionized software development and deployment by one of the best engineers in field. 

Also we will have speak about "DevOps", what is it and how it reshapes organization and software development. 

Following by networking/chit chat session 

Refreshments and light food will be provided.

* There are limited number of docker T-shirts available for early birds as well ;)
